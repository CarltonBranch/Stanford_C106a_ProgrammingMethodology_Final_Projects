Final projects from the Stanford University CS106A : Programming Methodology course

## Breakout Game 
Your job in this assignment is to write the classic arcade game of Breakout, which was invented by Steve Wozniak before he founded Apple with Steve Jobs. 

## Hangman Game
For this assignment, your mission is to write a program that plays the game of Hangman. When it plays Hangman, the computer first selects a secret word at random from a list built into the program. The program then prints out a row of dashes—one for each letter in the secret word and asks the user to guess a letter. If the user guesses a letter that is in the word, the word is redisplayed with all instances of that letter shown in the correct positions, along with any letters correctly guessed on previous turns. If the letter does not appear in the word, the user is charged with an incorrect guess. The user keeps guessing letters until either (1) the user has correctly guessed all the letters in the word or (2) the user has made eight incorrect guesses. 

## NameSurfer Graphing Application
The goal of this assignment is to create a program that graphs name popularity over time, as shown in the sample run in Figure 1. In this diagram, the user has just typed Samantha into the box marked ―Name‖ and then clicked on the ―Graph‖ button, having earlier done
exactly the same thing for the name Sam. Whenever the user enters a name, the NameSurfer program creates a new plot line showing how that name has fared over the decades. Clicking on the ― Clear button removes all the plot lines from the graph so that the user can enter more names without all the old names cluttering up the display.

## FacePamphlet MVC Friend Application
For this assignment, you will create an application that keeps tracks of the information in such a simple social network. More specifically, your application will allow for user profiles to be added to, deleted from, or looked-up in the social network. Moreover, for each profile, you will keep track of the person's name associated with that profile, an optional image that the person may wish to display with his/her profile, an optional"current status" for the profile (which is basically just a String indicating what activity
the owner of that profile is currently engaged in), and a list of friends for each profile.
